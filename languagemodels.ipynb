    "We want a model whose job is to guess the next character based on the previous n letters. For example, having seen `ello`, the next characer is likely to be either a commma or space (if we assume is is the end of the word \"hello\"), or the letter `w` if we believe we are in the middle of the word \"mellow\". Humans are quite good at this, but of course seeing a larger history makes things easier (if we were to see 5 letters instead of 4, the choice between space and `w` would have been much easier).\n",

    "We will call n, the number of letters we need to guess based on, the _order_ of the language model.\n",

    "RNNs and LSTMs can potentially learn infinite-order language model (they guess the next character based on a \"state\" which supposedly encode all the previous history). We here will restrict ourselves to a fixed-order language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are seeing `n` letters, and need to guess the `n+1`th one. We are also given a large-ish amount of text (say, all of Shakespear works) that we can use. How would we go about solving this task?\n",

    "Mathematiacally, we would like to learn a function `P(c | h)`. Here, `c` is a character, `h` is an `n`-letters history, and `P(c|h)` stands for how likely is it to see `c` after we've seen `h`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest approach would be to just count and divide (a.k.a **maximum likelihood estimates**). We will count the number of times each letter `c` appeared after `h`, and divide by the total numbers of letters appearing after `h`. The **unsmoothed** part means that if we did not see a given letter following `h`, we will just give it a probability of zero.\n",
